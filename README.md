Sleep dataset from SC Sleep-EDF Database that is freely available through Physionet at “https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/sleep-edfx/” for training and evaluation purposes.

The plan is to compare the performance of the 6 different classifiers: Naïve Base, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis, 
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and Multilayer Perceptron using 10-fold cross-validation starting from having only one feature and increasing 
the number of features to two (the first two features), then three (the first three features), then four (the first four features),.... until all 15 features are used.
